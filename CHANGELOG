# 2.0.1 Release
### No quests?

## What's changed?
**Added**
- New assembly factory
   └ Once again four recipe units at double the base speed
   └ Upgrades and stats are identical to the chemical factory
   └ Comes with an improved version of the old assemfac animations
- Space stations now emit a gentle, soothing hum inside pressurized rooms (a la ST:TNG), this can be muted/modified with /ntmclient set AUDIO_SHIP_HUM_VOLUME [0.0 - 1.0]

**Fixed**
- Fixed fusion reactor item IO being broken
- Fixed issue with the chemical factory where the declogging feature would be triggered by a recipe processor that doesn't even own the reported slot
- Fixed the new PA not triggering the omega-12 achievement
   └ In addition to granting the achievement to nearby players on recipe completion, it is also granted when taking it out of the output slot
- Fixed the PUREX recipe for processing ZIRNOX MEU fuel not yielding technetium as it should
- Fixed turbofans pulling in players even when disabled via redstone
- Minor localisation fixes
- PLSS audio sometimes doesn't play when multiple players with PLSSes are present in a given dimension
- "Unnamed" bedrock ore that causes crashes when inserted into a Bedrock Ore Processor
- A whole chunk of Block is allocated unnecessarily during structure generation
- Gas dock visually shows Jool Gas even on Tekto
- Crash with certain mods trying to spawn entities with a FakeWorld (why)
- Small custom missiles don't work (restored the UI elements that indicate what thrusters work with what warheads)

**Changed**
- Updated chinese localization
- Added more QMAW manual pages
- WIAJ presentations now use the same configurable keybind as QMAW
   └ Shift has to be held for the presentations, while F1 will open the standard QMAW page
- Added keyboard controls to the recipe selector's scroll function
   └ Up and down keys scroll by one line
   └ PgUp and PgDown scroll by 5 lines (full page)
   └ Pos1 and End keys scroll to the top and bottom of the list respectively
- C4, like semtex, is now edible
- Assembly machines can now be made with the assembly machine
   └ The recipe is similar to the anvil recipe, but it uses only half as much steel, and one analog circuit instead of four vacuum tubes
- Added a (LEGACY) tag to the schrabidium transmutator
- Existing schrabidium transmutators are now way slower
   └ get souped
- Removed the schraranium tooltip mentioning the transmutator
- Changed the last remaining recipes that use the old steel pipes item, as well as the recipe for the steel pipes
   └ Any remaining steel pipes can be either smelted in a crucible or shredded
- Basalt now has cobblestone oredict
- Earth crystalline bedrock is now: Redstone - Asbestos - Diamond - Emerald
   └ This means an Earth bedrock plant can produce all basic alloys! (Steel, Red Copper, Advanced Alloy)
- Duna now spawns repairable lanterns (at double the rate of Earth!)
- Schrabidium ore generates naturally on Eve
- Ike now has rad hotspots
- Red keyholes now spawn on all planets
- Space stations now see the satellites of the currently orbited body, allowing asteroid miners to function (but only when orbiting the correct planet!)
- Extra port added to the Electrolyser
- Platinum was kill (it was unused)
- PLSS now consumes oxygen when underwater, you'll drown as normal if you run out of O2
